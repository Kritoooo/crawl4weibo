## Key Discoveries Summary

### Architecture Type
- **Synchronous HTTP crawler** (not async)
- **Single-threaded** execution
- **Rate-limited** with hardcoded delays (1-3 sec minimum)
- **Proxy-aware** with dynamic/static pool support

### Rate Limiting
| Operation | Built-in Delay |
|-----------|-----------------|
| get_user_posts() | 1-3 sec |
| search_users() | 1-3 sec |
| search_posts() | 1-3 sec |
| Image downloads | 1-3 sec between images |
| Pagination | 2-4 sec between pages |
| 432 error retry | 4-7 sec backoff |

### Performance Baseline
**Single Client:** 0.25 ops/sec (~4 seconds per operation)
**5 Concurrent Clients:** 0.08-0.17 ops/sec combined
**Success Rate:** 90-95%

### Main Components
- **WeiboClient** (466 lines) - Main crawler class
- **ProxyPool** (189 lines) - Proxy management
- **ImageDownloader** (276 lines) - Image download utility
- **WeiboParser** (150+ lines) - JSON parsing

### Test Coverage
- **35+ total tests** across 5 test files
- Unit tests (mocked) for fast execution
- Integration tests (real API) for validation
- Coverage areas: client, proxy, downloader, models

## Key Insights for Performance Testing

### Strengths
- Clean synchronous API design
- Built-in rate limiting respects target server
- Comprehensive proxy pool management
- Strong retry and backoff mechanisms
- Good existing test coverage

### Testing Challenges
- Synchronous architecture limits concurrency (must use threading)
- Hardcoded delays prevent performance tuning
- Fixed 5-second timeout is not configurable
- Real API dependency for integration tests

### Recommended Test Approach
1. Use ThreadPoolExecutor for multi-client tests
2. Mock external calls for unit tests
3. Include built-in delays in throughput calculations
4. Test proxy pool separately from main crawling
5. Monitor resource usage during sustained load
